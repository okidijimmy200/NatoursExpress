-Aggregation and pipeline are very important mongodb framework for data aggregation
-we define a pipeline where all the documents from a certain collection are processed step by step inorder to transform
them to aggregated results
-we can use this to calculate averages

Lecture 3:

-we need to calculate how many tours start at the beginning of the month to solve the problem
-we have a situation where we have multiple adventures ie snow adventure, forest hiker, mountain climber and each is carried out 3 times a year
-so there are scenarios where we have months that have 2 of these activites
