ERROR HANDLING WITH EXPRESS
LECTURE 1:
Debugging NodeJs with ndb
-we cldwe vs code for Debugging or ndb by google
ndb----node debugger
*********npm i ndb --global************
or
*********npm i ndb --save-dev**********

--we then add a script in our package.json called debug
--so we run ****npm run debug****
--it installs and opens up a chromium web browser for you wch is a node debugger
--we can edit our files in our debugger and it updates the original code

NB: after performing any action on chromium, perfomr the save button


Break points
these r fundamental aspects of error HANDLING
-this is where the code will stop running and we will see our variables
-we create a breakpoint by clicking a number on the code thn right click --> run the script
-this opens up another serverjs showing us all the code tht has executed above the breakpoint
and we can check the variables like port set to 8080
-we can also see the results on the right side
--this also gives us access to all the functions used ie module, require, dirname, dirfile
--we also have the app variable wch contains the route
--it contains stack wch is the middleware stack we have in our application

--we do also have global variables where we have process variable
-we have process.env where all ur env variables r stored ie password, database string

-weh we are done, we can click the run button at the top right side to complete our execution and since there
is no error, it will complete well.


LECTURE 2:
Handling Unhandled Routes
-we implement error handling for routes that are not dfined in the app.js file
-the route shd be below other route to avoid it running fast

LECTURE 3:
An overvire of Error Handling:
-types of errors
Operational Errors                             Program errors
-problems we can preixt will happpen            bugs we developers introduce into our code, difficut to handle
at some pt, so we prepare 4 them                -reading properties on undefined
-inavlid path access                            -passing a number where an object is expected
-invalid user input                             -await without async
-failed to connect to serverjs                  -using req.query instead of req.body
-failed to connect to db
-request timeout

when dealing with errors in express, we mean operational errors wch are easy to catch and handle with our app
-we write a global error handling middleware to catch differnet errors

LECTURE 4:
Implementing a global error handling middleware
-how to write middleware func to handle operational errors

LECTURE 5:
Better Error and refactoring
-create a new file in utils
-create a new errorController fie wch we export to the appjs file

LECTURE 6:
Catching Errorss in Async functions
-we have try catch blocks in our async functions.
-we will take the async function with try and catch and place it into a new function
-we can also perform catchasyn in the toutController
-catchAsync is used inplace of try, catch

LECTURE 7:
Adding 404 Not Found Errors
-add 404 errors to our tour handler functions
-catchAsync is not very convient for routers
-how do we code an error in a situation where someone has placed an invalide id
-it now gives us no tour found with that id
-catchAsyn shd only be placed where its needed to avoid cases of putting it in a synchronous code

LECTURE 8:
ERROR DURING DEVELOPMENT VS PRODUCTION
-Implementing logic to send differnet messages for prod or dev
-in prod, we want to leak as little error about the program to the cliet as possible
-we send a nice human friendly as possible
-bt in dev, we neeed to have as much info as possible

--all the errors we create our selves will be operational errors
-we want to send these errors only to users in prod
-for other prog error from 3rd party lib, we dont need to send it
-so its important to distinguish btn errors in prod and development
