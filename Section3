USING MONGODB WITH MONGOOSE
LECTURE 1:
Connecting our database the express
-to access our mongodb database, we need a mongodb driver
-we will use mongoose

************npm install mongoose********

--incase the remote db fails, try changing the ip address connection
-env file works fine

--move to collection in mongodb atlas, create a new cluster collection

--on connect to cluster, click connect your application and get your connection string
-we connect to natours database in cluster 0
-we also create a variable for connection to local database

--this connects to the remote server
-we can now delete the tours collection to avoid inteference

LECTURE 2:

-mongoose gives us alot of functionality outside the box wch is necessary for fasterdevelopment
-it provides us with a schema to model data and relationships easy validtaion, simple query API, middleware
-mongoose schema: where we model our data by describing the structure of data, default values and validation
-mongoose model:a wrapper for schema, providing an interface to the database for CRUD operations
